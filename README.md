### Research

* [Mozilla Security and privacy-related preferences (Kb.mozillazine.org)](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Category:Security_and_privacy-related_preferences)
* [Mozilla Security Center (Mozilla.com)](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/)
* [Firefox security blog (blog.mozilla.com)](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/)
* [Browser hardening (Blog.torproject.org)](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/isec-partners-conducts-tor-browser-hardening-study)


**If somone want the ownership of this project he/she can contact me via eMail, I don't see any future in about:config or such hardening that's why I will drop the support here.**
