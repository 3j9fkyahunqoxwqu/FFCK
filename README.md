### ToDo

- [x] WebGL/OpenGL/D3D issue on Android/Windows - needs to be mentioned
- [x] DNS / NTP needs to be mentioned
- [ ] [Several test pages](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/Online-Privacy-Test-Resource-List) needs to be added to verify the current 'security' status.- Most people prefer something visual over cmd/shell. 
- [ ] Find a way to pick changed FF configurations and compare them to easier find new about:config changes
- [ ] Certificate 'hardening' is not necessary, better disable internal stuff and let the OS handle it but show or give people a way to harden the OS own certificates. This is better because the OS handles more as the browser. especially an Windows/or in general server based OS'es we should filter stuff on the lowest level. I'm working on something for this. (not public)
- [ ] Considering to remove WebPush? May breaks Telegram/WhatsApp WebServices
- [ ] Maybe syntax check to avoid failures within the user.js
- [ ] Pull requests and Ideas are always welcome!
- [ ] Since I not use PaleMoon the topic about this can be found over [here](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/FFCK/issues/2)
- [ ] Requests, random talk [belongs into this thread](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/FFCK/issues/3)
